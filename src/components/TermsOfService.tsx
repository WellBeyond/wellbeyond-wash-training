        fees. Before you pay any fees, including before activating or updating any
        recurring payments, you will have an opportunity to review the fees that
        you will be charged before you accept them. If you activate or update
        recurring payments through the Service, you authorize Well Beyond to

        d. <u>Disclaimer of Liability for Third-Party Services</u>. You are solely

        fraud when using Third-Party Services, and to protect your computer systems

      <p>
        a. <u>Generally</u>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and
        Well Beyond in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Well
        Beyond agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these
        Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration.
        Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and can be
        subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same
        damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate
        disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these
        Terms, Well Beyond's <a>Privacy Statement </a>
        , or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
        fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of
        whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU
        UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WELL
        BEYOND ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A
        CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE DISPUTE
        RESOLUTION TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOU AND WELL BEYOND UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT
        OUT PURSUANT TO SECTION 16.i BELOW.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether to agree to arbitration is an important business decision. It is
        your decision to make, and you should not rely solely on the information
        provided in these Terms as it is not intended to contain a complete
        explanation of the consequences of arbitration. You should take further
        steps to conduct research and to consult with others, including, but not
        limited to, an attorney, regarding the consequences of your decision, just
        as you would when making any other important business or life decision.    <strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        b. <u>Exceptions</u>. Despite the provisions of the Section entitled
        "Generally" directly above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive,
        preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an
        individual action in small claims court; (ii) bring an action in a court
        pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004,
        California Labor Code &#167; 2698 et seq.; (iii) seek injunctive relief in
        a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an
        intellectual property infringement claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. <u>Arbitrator</u>. Any arbitration between you and Well Beyond will be
        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial
        Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
        Related Disputes (collectively, "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") of the
        American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), as modified by
        these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing
        forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Well Beyond. The arbitrator has exclusive
        authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
        applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. <u>Notice; Process</u>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must
        first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail
        or electronic mail within the applicable statute of limitations period ("    <strong>Notice</strong>"). Well Beyond's address for Notice is: 411 West
        Monroe St., Austin, X 78704. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and
        basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
        ("<strong>Demand</strong>"). The parties will make good faith efforts to
        resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to
        do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Well Beyond may
        commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of
        any settlement offer made by you or Well Beyond must not be disclosed to
        the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award,
        if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your
        favor, Well Beyond will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the
        amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement
        amount offered by Well Beyond in settlement of the dispute prior to the
        arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        e. <u>Fees</u>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms,
        Well Beyond will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless
        your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case
        the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration
        hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Austin, Texas,
        but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the
        arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents
        submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone
        hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules
        in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds
        that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand
        is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
        standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the
        payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you
        agree to reimburse Well Beyond for all monies previously disbursed by it
        that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless
        of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must
        issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
        findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are
        based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
        payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
        proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
        arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
      </p>
      <p>
        f. <u>No Class Actions</u>. YOU AND WELL BEYOND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
        CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS
        A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
        PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN ACTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEYS
        GENERAL ACT OF 2004, CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE &#167; 2698 ET SEQ. WHICH ARE
        NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION 16). Further, unless both you and Well Beyond
        agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's
        claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
        class proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        g. <u>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</u>. If Well Beyond makes
        any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to
        Well Beyond's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us
        written notice within 30 days of the change to Well Beyond's address for
        Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
        prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes
        between you and Well Beyond. If you do not send such written notice, your
        continued use of the Services following any such change means that you have
        consented to such change.
      </p>
      <p>
        h. <u>Enforceability</u>. If the Section entitled "No Class Actions" is
        found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 16 is found to
        be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and
        void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction
        and venue described directly below will govern any action arising out of or
        related to these Terms or your use of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        i. <u>Opt Out</u><strong>.</strong> Arbitration is not a mandatory
        condition of these Terms. If you do not want to be subject to this Dispute
        Resolution provision, you may opt out of this Dispute Resolution provision
        by notifying Well Beyond in writing of your decision by sending, within 30
        days of the date you receive these Terms, an electronic message to
        support@wellbeyondwater.com, stating clearly your full name and intent to
        opt out of the Dispute Resolution provision. Should you choose not to opt
        out of this Dispute Resolution provision within the 30-day period, you and
        Well Beyond will be bound by the terms of this Dispute Resolution
        provision. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice
        concerning this Dispute Resolution provision. You understand that you will
        not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out of
        coverage under this Dispute Resolution provision.

        18. <strong>Protected Activity Not Prohibited.</strong> You should
        understand that, insofar as permitted by applicable law, nothing in these
        Terms will in any way limit or prohibit you from filing a charge or
        complaint with, or otherwise communicating or cooperating with or
        participating in any investigation or proceeding ("    <strong>Protected Activity</strong>") that may be conducted by any federal,
        state or local government agency or commission ("    <strong>Government Agencies</strong>"). You understand that in connection
        with such Protected Activity, you are permitted to disclose documents or
        other information as permitted by law, and without giving notice to, or
        receiving authorization from, Well Beyond. Notwithstanding, in making any
        such disclosures or communications, you agree to take all reasonable
        precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any
        information that may constitute Well Beyond confidential information to any
        parties other than the Government Agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        19. <strong>Governing Law; Choice of Forum</strong>. The laws of the State
        of Texas, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms and your
        use of the Services. Your use of the Services may also be subject to other
        local, state, national, or international laws; provided, however, that the
        United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
        will not apply to any provision of these Terms. To the extent that any
        action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a
        court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
        the state and federal courts located in Travis County and you hereby
        irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any
        defense of inconvenient forum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        20. <strong>Feedback</strong>. If you provide any feedback to Well Beyond
        concerning the functionality and performance of the Services (including
        identifying potential errors and improvements), you hereby assign to Well
        Beyond all right, title, and interest in and to such feedback, and Well
        Beyond is free to use such feedback without payment or restriction.
      </p>
      <p>
        21. <strong>Entire Agreement; Variation. </strong>These Terms set forth the
        entire agreement between Well Beyond and you with respect to the Services.
        These Terms supersede and govern all previous oral and written
        communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into these
        Terms. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing
        between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter
        these Terms. These Terms may be changed only by a written agreement signed
        by an authorized agent of the party against whom enforcement is sought.
      </p>
      <p>
        22. <strong>Severability. </strong>If any provision of these Terms is held
        invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provisions will be modified, or if
        not possible, severed, to reflect the fullest valid, legal, and enforceable
        expression of the intent of the parties and the remainder of these Terms
        will not be affected thereby.
      </p>
      <p>
        23. <strong>Relationship of Parties. </strong>Nothing herein will be deemed
        to create an employer-employee relationship between Well Beyond and you,
        nor any agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the
        parties. Neither party will have the right to bind the other to any
        obligation, nor have the right to incur any liability on behalf of the
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        24. <strong>Waiver. </strong>No delay, omission, or failure to exercise any
        right or remedy provided herein will be deemed to be a waiver thereof or an
        acquiescence in the event giving rise to such right or remedy, but every
        such right or remedy may be exercised, from time to time as may be deemed
        expedient by the party exercising such remedy or right.
      </p>
      <p>
        25. <strong>Assignment. </strong>Neither these Terms nor any of the rights
        granted to you herein may be assigned or transferred by you, whether
        voluntarily or by operation of law, without the express prior written
        permission of Well Beyond and any attempt to do so will be null and void.
        However, Well Beyond may assign or transfer these Terms at any time without
        your permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        26. <strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries. </strong>The provisions of these
        Terms relating to the rights of Well Beyond content providers are intended
        for the benefit of such content providers, and such content providers, as
        third-party beneficiaries, will be entitled to enforce such provisions in
        accordance with their terms, irrespective of the fact that they are not
        signatories to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTICE REGARDING APPLE. You acknowledge that these Terms are between you
        and Well Beyond only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the
        Services or the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to
        furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Services.
        In the event of any failure of the Services to conform to any applicable
        warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase
        price for the relevant Services to you; and, to the maximum extent
        permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation
        whatsoever with respect to the Services. Apple is not responsible for
        addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Services or
        your possession and/or use of the Services, including, but not limited to:
        (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Services fails to
        conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims
        arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not
        responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any
        third party claim that the Services or your possession and use of the
        Services infringes that third party's intellectual property rights. You
        agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the
        Services. Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of
        these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the
        right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these
        Terms against you as a third party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby
        represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is
        subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the
        U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (ii) you are not
        listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. If
        Well Beyond provides a translation of the English language version of these
        Terms, the translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English
        version will prevail.
